# Hi There!

Welcome to [io.davidseah.com]({{ site.url }}). This site is built on Jekyll and hosted on GitHub pages. 
The goal is to make a useful "reference notebook" site that works better than my current Wordpress-based solution.

{% include LZIMG src='site-logo.png' 
   style='left' nopopup=false
   caption="optional caption goes here"
%}
