## Knowledge System Organization

Sri's Knowledge Base Filing System (SRI-KBFS) is a file-based notebook system design for easy entering of data in a Markdown-derived format. The goals are:

* Unique user-entered ids ('SRID') with generated external short refs ('XURL')
* Derived document from source collection with generated SRID codes

Features:

* Low-friction text-based editing of working notes
* Automatic transformation of notes into publishable works-in-progress
* Automatic back-annotation into source docs of references to other content
* Automatic summary extraction from first paragraph on page with lead-in 'SUMMARY:' keyword.
* Automatic title extraction from first header on page
* Automatic indexing and reference link replacement/insertion
* Automatic change and document history (using Git)
* Automatic category and index page generation
* Generate visualization to show content and tag relationships.
* Enhanced markup language based on Markdown

The system is being prototyped using off-the-shelf static site generators. I'm using JEKYLL currently.

## Concept: Publish on Assignment of ID

Folders and files are used to store content, but are not used to generate pathnames. Use files and folders in any way to keep track of temporary notes. To register a note with the system, add a `SRID` of the form `0000:YYYY:MMDD:HHMM` to generate a unique id within your file store. KBFS will generate a public file that can be addressed by a `XURL` or by `SRID`; these are the "evergreen canonical links". 

## Reference: SRI-KBS Front Matter

* **`SRID`** Sri Knowledge Base File System Id - Of the form `0000-YYYY-MMDD-HHMM`. User codes begin with `0000`, and generated codes for derived content start with `1000`. 
* **`STAG`** Content Tag - Used for informal tag names. Case insensitive, alphanumeric no spaces or punctuation in Sri Tag Group Format: 'tag', 'tag1, tag2', 'agroupname: tag1, tag2', 'tag (long tag string name)'
* **`SGRP`** Group/Project Short Name) - Used to group related content. Multiple SGRP keys are allowed.
* **`SORD`** Group/Project Numbered Section - used to sort content within a SGRP. Integers using dotted decimal notation (e.g. 1.1.2). Fewer decimals are preferred. Content with SORD is ordered above content without SORD on generated table of contents pages.
* **`SKEY`** Group/Project Sort Key - a hierarchical alpha-sorted key used to order related documents of the form 'path/to/subsection'. Sorting is the same as unix directory sorting, and is overriden by `SORD`
* **`XURL`** External URL - A SRI-KBFS hash of `SRID` using Hashids and our custom alphabet. Used for sharing links to source content.
* **`XCAT`** External Library Categorization Code - A string designating another categorization scheme such as Dewey Decimal System or Library of Congress. Multiple XCAT entries can exist.

Some of these tags are generated (e.g. `XURL`). In general the `S*` names designate internal SRI-KBFS uses and `X*` names are for external references by the public.

#### NOTES

> "I needed a [replacement for hexadecimal][^1] (base 16) for similar reasons (e.g. for encoding a key, etc.), the best I could come up with is the following set of 16 characters, which can be used as a replacement for hexadecimal:"
```
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D E F
H M N 3 4 P 6 7 R 9 T W C X Y F
