# Extras

Aside from the project work itself, one of my goals is to create a positive community for creative entrepreneurs that dislike meaningless networking. 

If any of these activities appeal to you, I invite you to contact me. 

* **Meeting in-person** for coworking sessions, in person and online, to stay energized.

* **Pooling resources** to gather, improve, and share inspirational skill development because people are doing cool stuff all the time.

* **Talk shop about our development work** with other developers and see each other's work develop over time in a non-competitive supportive environment. 

I participate in a few area meetups and run an online virtual coworking chat room. Give a holler if you'd like to know more, or check out my website at [davidseah.com](https://davidseah.com)
