If you find our projects relevant to your interests and would like to (1) talk shop and/or (2) work out a way to "learn on the job", we might be able to work something out! One of my side gigs is helping people to share what they're learning with each other through collaborative community building through:

* **Meeting in-person** for coworking sessions, in person and online, to stay energized.

* **Pooling resources** to gather, improve, and share inspirational skill development because people are doing cool stuff all the time.

* **Talking shop about our development experiences** and seeing each other's work develop over time in a non-competitive supportive environment. 

I participate in a few area meetups and run an online virtual coworking chat room. Give a holler if you'd like to know more, or check out my website at [davidseah.com](https://davidseah.com).
