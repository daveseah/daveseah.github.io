# Job Description

I am looking for **contract programmers** to help us implement classroom-based learning systems. I'd like to find programmers with experience in **ANY** of the following areas:

* **Javascript** development and related tooling
* **NodeJS** back-end systems programming, web services
* Web application development with **React** ecosystem.
* HTML5/CSS interface development with **Material UI**
* Browser-side drawing and rendering technologies (Canvas/SVG/WebGL)

We don't expect a single person to embody all these skills, so if you are familiar with ANY of them, let's talk!

If you have additional experience in **any** of these specialized areas, that would be a big bonus. We are actively dealing with these issues:

* Implementing User authentication and session management
* Cross-platform application development
* Unit Testing and QA
* Algorithms for computer graphics and "game-style" AI
* Time-based simulation
* Computer animation techniques and frameworks
* App development for IOS, Android
* Advanced graphics and user interface technologies
* Arduino/Raspberry Pi and IoT
* WebRTC and Web Video
* Software architectural patterns
* Managing Open Source Software projects
* Documentation and Knowledge Management
* Graphic Design

This is paying work for perhaps 4 and 200 hours of work. The number of hours will depend on what we scope based on your experience and our needs. You would be working directly with me (Dave Seah) and Dr. Ben Loh (a principal of edtech company [Inquirium LLC](http://inquirium.net)) to set clear goals and deliverables. 

We also may be able to work with programmers who want to develop expertise in the above technologies under some kind of hybrid arrangement. Let's talk! See the [Extras](/bulletin/001-xtra) section for more information.

### Past and Ongoing Projects

The following projects will give you an idea of the kind of work you would be helping with:

* 2004 **Showing Evidence** - A web application for teaching reasoning skills within a classroom setting built with Flash Actionscript 2 for Intel Education. 
[blog post](https://davidseah.com/2005/06/intel-education-showing-evidence/)

* 2009 **Take a Stand** - A museum installation using 3D simulation with overhead motion tracking. Small groups of students use their body motion to control animal avatars in a virtual pond to facilitate discussion of standing-up to bullies. Custom 3D game engine running on dedicated PC hardware client and tracker server,  written in C# and XNA, for the Illinois Holocaust Museum.

* 2013  **Science through Technology Enhanced Play (STEP)** - A multi-classroom installation using motion tracking, simulation, and screen projection to present science course material for K-2 students as a research data platform in a large space. Javascript, WebGL web app was served from a Macintosh laptop interfacing to motion capture system through a NodeJS backend. For NSF-funded research conducted by UCLA and Indiana University investigators.
